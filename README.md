# Stocks-Dataset-Analysis
## Project Summary:
Stocks-Dataset-Analysis-Part-1:
Using a public data set with information on stock trades made by members of the US House of Representatives from  the House Stock Watcher project, 
I analyzed how COVID-19 affected the proportion of stocks that  achieved over $200 in capital gains from 2018-2022. The methods I used to analyze the data set
included data cleaning, assessment of missing data, TVDs, analyzing  distributions, and hypothesis testing using standard null and alternate hypotheses, test
statistics, p-values, and alpha levels. I utilized Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and NumPy to conduct my analysis.

Stocks-Dataset-Analysis-Part-2:
Using the same data set used in part 1, I formulated a machine learning model to predict the ownership type (joint, self, etc.) of a stock. Methods I used to conduct my analysis included pipelines, transformers, one-hot encoding, a random forest  classifier, and fairness evaluation. I utilized Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to complete this project.
